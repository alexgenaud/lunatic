    <h2>Babylonian cycles, NASA data, simplified math</h2>

    <h2>Second and day</h2>
    <p>
        For our simplified Babylonian purposes,
        we'll assume a second and day are exactly what we think they are.
        However, we must keep in mind that in truth,
        few astronomical constants are simple or actually constant.
        We must approximate, average out, guess or ignore long term discrepancies.
    </p>
    <p>
        A full day is assumed to represent the duration from the Sun's position
        in the sky to the same position again
        exactly twenty-four hours later, as observed from the same location on Earth.

        The SI second is strictly defined by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard">radiation of a caesium atom</a>,
        and assumed to be a sixtieth of each of sixty minutes of
        twenty-four equal hours dividing a consistent solar day.
    </p>
    <p>
        We might therefor expect exactly 86400 seconds every day.
        However, in any typical year a solar day might be about 86380 to 86430 SI seconds long.
        The day might have been more consistent if the Earth's oceans and crust were static,
        its rotation and orbit around the Sun
        were perfectly circular and uninfluenced by any other bodies,
        such as the Moon, Jupiter, our and other galaxies.
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time">mean solar day</a>
        is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">slightly slow</a>
        although inexplicably seems to have been accelerating toward "normal" in recent years.
    </p>
    <h2>The year</h2>
    <p>
        There are many definitions of the year, however we typically assume the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year">tropical year</a>.
        Certainly, the most popular calendars of the past several millenia
        approximate the tropical year, also known as the seasonal year.
        In turn the seasons are defined by the equinoxes and solstices,
        although all four accelerate and decelerate somewhat independantly.
        To get an idea of why, how, or what that looks like:
        watch the sloshy rotation of a thrown bottle partially filled with liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overwelmingly, cultures of the northern hemisphere marked the begining of the tropical year with the spring
        equinox.
        It's when the Sun rises in the traditional sign of Aries, Aviv in Hebrew bible, and Nisan or Arah Nisanu in the
        Babylonian calendar.
        The Babylonians had a remarkably accurate estimate of the mean tropical year and may have been aware of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession">precession of the equinoxes</a>.
        None the less, the Hebrews, Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans, inherited an error of a day in some hundreds of
        years.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian calendar</a>,
        proposed in 46 BC, inserted a leap day every four years and no less.
        The Romans likely could have been more precise given the best contemporary knowledge,
        but it was anyway a vast improvement over the previous "years of confusion".
        Sixteen centuries later, after 1582, our
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>
        introduced a few exceptions
        (no leap year every 100 years unless divisible by 400),
        that will err again in another sixteen centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jean Meeus and Denis Savoie in 1992
        estimated the tropical year with exceptionally high precision in several ways,
        averaging to a bit more than 365.242 days (of 86400 SI seconds each).
        The northward equinox slowed by an hour since Julius Caesar
        and the southern equinox more than made up the difference.
        That pattern will surely flop around eventually (like the unbalanced thrown water bottle mentioned earlier).
        And in any case, the SI second or SI day is not how we perceive the length of the year anyway.
        We perceive the year by the number of sunrises, noons, or sunsets in four seasons, not according to atomic
        seconds.
        For whatever it's worth, the mean tropical year from
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Point_of_Aries">Aries</a>
        in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)">2000</a>
        (reference epoch, plus and minus ten millenia) was 365.2421896698
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris_day">ephemeris days</a> and changing.
        Dr Irv Bromberg, creator of the
        <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/rect.htm">Rectified Hebrew Calendar</a>
        would insist that the mean northward equinoctial year of 365.242362 mean solar days
        is more relevant for our purposes.
        Meeus and Savoie's northward estimate for the year 2000 was 365.242374 SI days.
    </p>
    <p>
        I leave the most appropriate and accurate number of days in the tropical year as an excercise for the reader,
        ... :)

    <h2>Months</h2>
    <p>
        There are several definitions of the month and their distinctions are relevant for our purposes.
        Since before the ancient Sumerians through NASA astronomers,
        we will use eclipses to precisely calibrate several cycles, three lunar cycles in particular.
        The synodic month or a single lunation is a full cycle of the observable phases of the moon,
        from conjunction, first quarter, full, last quarter, to conjunction again.
        The anomalistic month is from the closest to furthest to closest again.
        The draconic month is the crossing of the lunar plane through the solar plane to the same node again.
    </p>
    <h2>Synodic month</h2>
    <p>
        The synodic month is most often what one means by a lunar month (as opposed to a 30 or 31 days solar calendar
        month).
        It inludes the new and full moons and the quarters in between.
        In many traditions, the new moon refered to the first visible evening crescent.
        In ancient Egypt, the lunar month began after the last morning crescent, several days before the first evening
        crescent.
        More recently in China, though still in ancient times, the new moon refered the conjunction of the Moon and Sun.
        The conjunction may today be refered to as an 'astronomical new moon', black or dark moon to distinguish
        the precise moment of conjunction from one of the visible crecent moons.
    </p>
    <p>
        The phases of the Moon are traditionally presented as a proportion of Sun light reflected
        from the Moon observed at an arbitrary location on the surface of the Earth.
        The phases imperceivably differ from a more precise and universal astronomic definition,
        as the 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree angles measured from
        the center of the Sun to the center of Earth to the center of the Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the synodic month appears to be a single visible cycle, it is derived from several astronomic cycles,
        including the Earth's rotation (day), orbit (year),
        the Moon's orbit around the Earth, and its own anomaly from perigee to perigee.
        Regardless of definition, the full synodic cycle averages about 29.53 days
        but a difference of about seven hours between the shortest to longest month.
        The half cycle can vary from shortest to longest by 40 hours.
        The shortest quarter to the longest quarter may differ by about 19 hours.
    </p>
    <h2>Anomalistic month</h2>
    <p>
        The anomalistic month refers to the Moon's eliptical orbit around the Earth
        from its closest point (perigee), furthest (appogee), to closest again.
        The anomalistic month is approximately 27.55455 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Chaldean Babylonian astronomer Kidinnu is credited with discovering
        the very accurate approximate equivilent ratio of 251 synodic to 269 anamalistic months.
        The 7412.17 day cycle accurately predicts the lunar phases to within hours for hundreds of years (TODO verify).
        It's difficult to imagine Kidinnu was unaware of, indeed reduced the primes factors from, 17 of these cycles.
        Yet, Ptolemy credits Hipparchus with discovering the larger solar eclipse cycle of
        (17)251 synodic, (17)261 anomalistic, 4630.5 draconic months, in 345 tropical years.
    </p>
    <h2>Draconic month</h2>
    <p>
        The moon's orbit is tilted approximately 5 degrees to the ecliptic.
        The plane of the Moon's orbit crosses the plane of the Sun's
        orbit (as observed from Earth) at two conceptual nodes in the sky.
        The Moon descends or ascends the same node twice in 27.21222 days.
        The draconic is also known as the eclipse month.

        While the full draconic cycle includes both a descending and ascending node,
        an eclipses is equally probably at either node (half cycle).
        A lunar eclipse is visible when the full Moon crosses the plane of the Sun.
        A solar eclipse is visible when the Moon and Sun are in conjunction while the moon crosses either node.
        The eclipse will be characteristically similar to another eclipse at the same point in the anomalistic cycle.
    </p>
    <h2>Arithmetic cycles</h2>
    <h2>Octaeteris cycle</h2>
    <p>
        An eight year cycle.
        The Octaeteris is not particularly accurate, but correlates Lunar, Venus, and the tropical year in
        a short observable timeframe.
        It includes two leap years, exactly equivilent to the Julian tropical year
        (and equally inaccurate).
        There are approximately 99 synodic and 106 anomalistic months in 8 years.
    </p>
    <h2>Short lunar cycles</h2>
    <p>
        13 synodic months is almost two days behind 14 anomalistic months.
        12 synodic months is about half a day ahead of 13 draconic months.

        None of these are


    <h2>Meton cycle</h2>
    <p>
        While earlier known to the Babylonians, we name 235 synodic months in 19 tropical years
        after the Greek astronomy Meton.
        This cycle was used in the late Babylonian calendar
        to schedule seven 13 month leap years among twelve 12 month regular years.
        It was incorporated into the Hebrew calendar by Hillel II
        via Persia, centuries after Cyrus conquered Babylon.
        The Meton cycle is ahead of the tropic year by one day in 218 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are approximately 255 draconic months in one Meton cycle, making a decent eclipse cycle.
        For example, saros 119 on 9 April 1986, saros 129 on 8 April 2005,
        <a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros139.html">saros 139</a> on 8 April 2024,
        saros 149 on and 9 April 2043.
    </p>
    <h2>Kidinnu cycle</h2>
    <p>
        Not an accepted name, but the cycle is attributed to Kidinnu and
        fundamental to "System B" also credited to Kidinnu.
        The Kidinnu cycle is the very accurate 251 synodic to 269 anomalistic month
        (7412.178 vs 7412.174 days) approximate equivilence.
        The synodic will be one day ahead of the anomalistic in 5476 years.
    </p>

    <h2>Hipparchus cycle</h2>
    <p>
        Ptolemy and modern historians tend to credit Hipparchus with multiplying Kidinnu's cycle by 17.
        It is not known whether Hipparchus himself claimed to discover
        this cycle independantly as his original sources are lost.
        However, it's much more likley that Kidinnu or earlier
        Babylonians noticed this cycle from their own eclipse records
        and simply reduced both terms by the obvious common prime factor.
        It's difficult to otherwise imagine how Kidinnu discovered the
        incredibly accurate but not directly observable reduced ratio.
        This eclipse cycle, understood to modernity as 25 inex minux 21 saros, consists of
    </p>
    <p>
        (17) 251 synodic (126007.02 days) = (17) 269 anomaly (126006.96 days) = 4630.5 draconic (126006.19 days) =
        345 tropical years (126008.6 days)
    </p>

    <p>
        The "long draconitic" lunar period is also often attributed
        to Hipparchus although we have earlier Babylonian records in stone.
        5458 synodic (161177.954 days) = 5923 draconic (161177.984 days)
    </p>

    <h2>Hundred to thousand year cycles</h2>
    <p>
        7014 synodic (207127.5503 days) = 7517 anomaly (207127.5515 days).
        3803 synodic (112304.829 days) = 4127 draconic (112304.835 days).
        4690 anomaly (129230.839 days) = 4749 draconic (129230.837 days).
        353 tropical years (128930.558 days) = 4366 synodic (128930.551 days).
    </p>

    <p>
        143892 synodic (4249215.49239 days) = 156151 draconic (4249215.49248 days) in 11634 years
    </p>

    <p>

        292303 synodic (8631879.715837 days) = 317206 draconic (8631879.715843 days) in 23633 years and 107 days.
        (11) 26573 synodic = 2 (199) 797 draconic months.
    </p>

    <h2>Saros cycle</h2>
    <p>
        The most famous eclipse cycle of exactly 223 synodic months and approximately
        239 anomalistic, 242 draconic months,
        in 19 "eclipse years" (38 "eclipse seasons"),
        seen about 120 degrees west after
        18 tropical years and 10, 11, or 12 days later.
        A saros series includes 69 to 87 eclipses in 1226 to 1550 years.

        The name is based on an unfortunate misunderstanding of the Babylonian saru 3600.

        A sar, or half saros, correlates solar and lunar eclipses.

        An exeligmos, or triple saros, will predict a similar eclipse
        54 years, 32 or 33 days later seen from approximately the same region.
        (3) 223 synodic (19755.96 days) = (3) 239 anomaly (19756.61 days) = (3) 242 draconic (19756.07 days)
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example,
        <a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros139.html">saros series 139</a>
        (30 of 71) will experience 4'28" totality on
        2024 April 8 18:18 near Nazas, Durango, Mexico.
        The previous exeligmos through southern Mexico was 7 March 1970.
        The next through Mexico will be 11 May 2078 (saros 139, inex 52).
        The first partial solar eclipse of saros 139 occured 17 May 1501.
        The first total eclipse in the series on 21 December 1843.
        The 71st and last partial eclipse of saros 139 will be 3 July 2763.
    </p>

    <h2>Inex cycle</h2>
    <p>
        The Inex eclipse cycle is exactly 358 synodic, 383.67 anomalistic, 388.5 draconic months,
        in 30.5 eclipse years (61 eclipse seasons).
        The Inex cycle is about 29 tropical years minus 20 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inex series 52 from 5275 BC beyond 15000 AD, most recently included
        saros 137 on 21 June 2020 through N India,
        followed by saros 138 on 31 May 2049 over the Atlantic,
        then saros 139 on 11 May 2078 through Mexico.
