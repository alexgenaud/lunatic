Calendar history is a series of confusion and correction,
regression, confusion and correction.

    Let there be lights in the Heavens to separate day from night;
    let them be for signs, seasons, days, and years ...
    the Sun to rule the day, the Moon to rule the night
    (Genesis 1:14)

The oldest recorded Sumerian calendar named the lunar months,
intercalating an extra month before March or September
to align the first and seventh months with the equinoxes.
The Babylonians inserted a second Elul before Tishri once
and inserted six Beta (a second Adar or Adar II) before Nisan in 19 years.
Following Cyrus, only and exactly seven Beta were inserted before Nisan in 19 years.

Greek and Roman politics rendered their lunar calendars inconsistent
until after 46 BC when Julius Casar established a solar calendar
with a leap day every four years.
Unfortunately this was slightly too many,
such that by 1582, March 20 was ten days ahead of the equinox.
Similarly, the Hebrew calendar established by Hilell II in 359,
has accumulated error such that Passover is a month late approximately every three years.
If not corrected in future millenia,
Passover will be over a month late every year.
The Gregorian calendar corrected the Julian drift
to realigned 20 March with the equinox
as in the year of the First Council of Nicaea in 325.
Without further correction (like the Orthodox Reformed Julian or Persian Solar Hijri)
20 March will align with the equinox, give or take a day, and some hours.

If we begin Nisan after the conjunction after 5 March,
the moon will nearly always be full after the March equinox.
The full moon can be 13-16 days after conjunction and the equinox can be 19-21 March.
If concerned with strict alignment or postponement,
one might confirm the previous rule when the conjunction is between 3-8 March.
Earlier conjunctions always require Beta, pushing Nisan from February toward April.

Lunar months can be 29 or 30 days and often alternate.
Rarely up to three 29 day months or four 30 day months are observed in sequence.
Yet there from the conjunction of Nisan to the full
(if 5 March conjection, the seventh full moon with always be 12 or 13 September)
Thus already in September, it can be determined whether Beta (second Adar) must be inserted before the following Nisan.

EDIT


The full moon of Tishri will be six months and 7 or 8 days after Nisan conjunction.
The full moon of Heshvan will be seven months and 7 or 8 days after Nisan conjunction.


The Sun rules days from Spring (March equinox) and the Moon rules nights from Autumn (September equinox).


The seventh full moon is always 191 or 192 days
(six Gregorian months and 7 or 8 days) after Nisan's conjunction.
For example conjunction 5 March and full moon 12 or 13 September.
Conjunction 20 March and full moon 27 or 28 September.
Conjunction 30 March and full moon  7 or  8 October.
Conjunction  1 April and full moon  9 or 10 October.

There are likewise only two possible day counts between the full moon of Tishri
and the two conjunctions (Adar or Beta) and Nisan.
There are 162 or 163 days (five Gregorian months and 9 or 10 days)
from the full moon of Tishri to conjunction of Adar.
There are 190 or 191 days from the full moon of Tishri to the subsequent
conjunction (Beta or Nisan).
However, because of the possible leap day 29 February,
there may be three different Gregorian dates for the conjunctions.
For example
full moon 25 September and  5,  6, or  7 March conjunction.
Full moon 10 October   and 20, 21, or 22 March conjunction.

If the full moon is early, then Beta (second Adar) will be inserted.
For example
full moon 12 September and inserted Beta conjunction on
    21, or 22 February before
    1, 2, or 3 April conjunction of Nisan.
Full moon 22 September, early Beta conjunction on
    2, 3, or 4 March before
    1, 2, or 3 April conjunction of Nisan.


Because of the 29 February leap day,
there are three possibilities from Tishri full moon to the next conjunction before Nisan.

====


The new and full moons of Nisan and Tishri align well with the March and September equinoxes.
The first conjunction of Nisan in early March will align the full moon closely with the equinox.
However, if the first conjunction of Nisan is late March, the full moon of Tishri will be in early October yet still closest to the September equinox.

Note that the Hebrew calendar drifts a week later each millenium, due to its strict adherence to the subtly erroneous Meton Cycle.
Nisan need never begin in April unless for example Passover 14th must be observed after the vernal equinox.

A sequence of four thirty day month (30 30 30 30) is possible.
A sequence of three twenty-nine day months (29 29 29) is possible.

The following six lunar month patterns are possible:

:  146 + 30 = 176 days
:  147 + 29 = 176 days

:  147 + 30 = 177 days
:  148 + 29 = 177 days

:  148 + 30 = 178 days
:  149 + 29 = 178 days

:  149 + 30 = 179 days
